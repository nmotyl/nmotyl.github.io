The [FileTransfer solution](https://github.com/nmotyl/scripts/tree/master/FileTransfer) provides the user a means of moving files between two database servers, without file copy, ftp, or other traditional file movement process. Complete usage instructions can be found in the [scripts repository wiki](https://github.com/nmotyl/scripts/wiki/File-Transfer), but you may feel free to email me should you have questions. Enjoy!
