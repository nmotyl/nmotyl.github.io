The [dynamic database](https://github.com/nmotyl/scripts/tree/master/DynamicDB) is a completely data driven schema. The goal of this database is to allow small to medium teams to rapidly model and store schemas in an enterprise database, which in turn, requires almost zero additional operation administration as team quantities increase. In addition to the core function of the database, the scripts are a nice example of several T-SQL techniques like XML manipulation and dynamic SQL. Complete usage instructions can be found in ReadMe.pdf, but you may feel free to email me should you have questions. Enjoy!
