The [dynamic database](https://github.com/nmotyl/scripts/tree/master/DynamicDB) is a completely data driven schema. The goal of this database is to allow small to medium teams to rapidly model and store schemas in an enterprise database, which in turn, requires almost zero additional operation administration as team quantities increase.
