The [AuditTable scripts](https://github.com/nmotyl/scripts/tree/master/AuditTable) provide a sample methodology for satisfying DML audit requirements. Complete usage instructions can be found in the [scripts repository wiki](https://github.com/nmotyl/scripts/wiki/Audit-Table), but you may feel free to email me should you have questions. Enjoy!
